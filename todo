* pause hides map
* fix artifacts criteria on text rendering
* string render markup for easel
* extend criteria mechanism:
    - determine criteria success rate
    - assign failsafe criteria, i.e. additional criteria, used in case of previous criteria failure (insufficient success rate)
* agent-plug-hole distance criteria needs to consider agent movements specifics(use distance not to plug,
    but to a tile, opposite to hole's position), see fail-example-01.png
* search for slow parts in agent-plug-hole criteria, except performance calc
** use jprofiler to see slow parts
* generate tactical options without ones passing same time twice
* heavy calculations must be carried out outside main agent thread in order not to interfere with pause/stop
