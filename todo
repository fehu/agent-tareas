* pause hides map
* fix artifacts on text rendering
* string render markup for easel
* agent-plug-hole distance criteria needs to consider agent movements specifics, see fail-example-01.png, fail-example-02.png
* heavy calculations must be carried out outside main agent thread in order not to interfere with pause/stop
* maybe build Floyd-Warshall distances map only for a piece of map, that participates in criteria in order of performance enhancement
